  <p>This CRAN task view contains a list of packages which offer
  facilities for solving optimization problems.
  Although every regression model in statistics solves an optimization
  problem they are not part of this view. If you are looking for regression
  methods, the following views will contain useful starting points:
  <view>Multivariate</view>, <view>SocialSciences</view>, <view>Robust</view> 
  among others. The focus of this task view is on 
  <a href="#optimization-infrastructure-packages">Optimization Infrastructure 
  Packages</a>, 
  <a href="#general-purpose-continuous-solvers">General Purpose Continuous 
  Solvers</a>, <a href="#mathematical-programming-solvers">Mathematical 
  Programming Solvers</a>, and 
  <a href="#specific-applications-in-optimization">Specific Applications in
  Optimization</a>, or <a href="#multi-objective-optimization">Multi 
  Objective Optimization</a>.
  Packages are categorized according to these sections.</p>

  <p>Many packages provide functionality for more than one
  of the subjects listed at the end of this task view. E.g., mixed
  integer linear programming solvers typically offer standard linear 
  programming routines like the simplex algorithm. Therefore following each 
  package description a list of abbreviations describes the typical features
  of the optimizer (i.e., the problems which can be solved). The
  full names of the abbreviations given in square brackets can be
  found at the end of this task view under 
  <a href="#classification-according-to-subject">Classification According to
  Subject</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="optimization-infrastructure-packages">
  Optimization Infrastructure Packages</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The <pkg>optimx</pkg> package provides a replacement and extension of 
    the <code>optim()</code> function in Base R with a call to several 
    function minimization codes in R in a single statement. These methods 
    handle smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or many 
    parameters. Function <code>optimr()</code> in this package extends the 
    <code>optim()</code> function with the same syntax but more 'method' 
    choices. Function <code>opm()</code> applies several solvers to a selected 
    optimization task and returns a dataframe of results for easy comparison. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The R Optimization Infrastructure (<pkg>ROI</pkg>) package 
    provides a framework for handling optimization problems in R. 
    It uses an object-oriented approach to define and solve various
    optimization tasks from different problem classes (e.g., linear, quadratic, 
    non-linear programming problems). This makes optimization transparent 
    for the user as the corresponding workflow is abstracted from the 
    underlying solver. The approach allows for easy switching between 
    solvers and thus enhances comparability. For more information see the 
    <a href="http://roi.r-forge.r-project.org/">ROI home page</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The package <pkg>CVXR</pkg> provides an object-oriented modeling 
    language for Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP). It allows the user 
    to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural way following 
    mathematical convention and DCP rules. The system analyzes the problem, 
    verifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical form, and hands it 
    off to an appropriate solver such as ECOS or SCS to obtain the solution.
    (CVXR is derived from the MATLAB toolbox CVX, developed at Stanford 
    University, cf. <a href="https://cvxr.rbind.io">CVXR home page</a>.)</li>
  </ul>

  Open Source Optimizers</a></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Package <pkg>clpAPI</pkg> provides high level access from R to
    low-level API routines of the <a
    href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp">COIN OR Clp</a> solver
    library. [LP]</li>

    <li>Package <pkg>lpSolve</pkg> contains the routine
    <code>lp()</code> to solve LPs and MILPs by calling the freely
    available solver <a
    href="http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net">lp_solve</a>. This solver is
    based on the revised simplex method and a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B)
    approach. It supports semi-continuous variables and Special Ordered
    Sets (SOS). Furthermore <code>lp.assign()</code> and
    <code>lp.transport()</code> are aimed at solving assignment problems
    and transportation problems, respectively. Additionally, there is the
    package <pkg>lpSolveAPI</pkg> which provides an R interface to the
    low level API routines of lp_solve (see also project
    <rforge>lpsolve</rforge> on R-Forge).
    <pkg>lpSolveAPI</pkg> supports reading linear programs from files in lp
    and MPS format. [BP, IP, LP, MILP, SPLP]</li>

    <li>Packages <pkg>glpkAPI</pkg> as well as
    package <pkg>Rglpk</pkg> provide an interface to the <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">GNU Linear Programming
    Kit</a> (GLPK). Whereas the former provides high level access
    to low level routines the latter offers a high level routine
    <code>Rglpk_solve_LP()</code> to solve MILPs using GLPK.  Both
    packages offer the possibility to use models formulated in the MPS
    format. [BP, IP, IPM, LP, MILP]</li>

    <li><pkg>Rsymphony</pkg> has the routine <code>Rsymphony_solve_LP()</code> 
    that interfaces the SYMPHONY solver for mixed-integer linear programs.
    (SYMPHONY is part of the <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/">Computational 
    Infrastructure for Operations Research</a> (COIN-OR) project.) 
    Package <code>lpsymphony</code> in Bioconductor provides a similar 
    interface to SYMPHONY that is easier to install. [LP, IP, MILP]</li>

    <li>The NOMAD solver is implemented in the <pkg>crs</pkg> package
    for solving mixed integer programming problems. This algorithm is
    accessible via the <code>snomadr()</code> function and is
    primarily designed for constrained optimization of blackbox
    functions. [MILP]</li>

    <li>'Clp' and 'Cbc' are open source solvers from the COIN-OR suite.
    'Clp' solves linear programs with continuous objective variables and is 
    available through <pkg>ROI.plugin.clp</pkg>. 'Cbc' is a powerful mixed 
    integer linear programming solver (based on 'Clp'); package 'rcbc' can 
    be installed from: <github>dirkschumacher/rcbc</github> (on Github).
    [LP, MILP]</li>

<!-- <li>Packages Rbonmin and Rlago provide interfaces to the corresponding 
     mixed integer nonlinear optimizers part of the 
     <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/">COIN-OR</a> project. They are currently 
     being developed on R-Forge in project <rforge>rino</rforge>. [NLP] </li>
